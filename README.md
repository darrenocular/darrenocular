# Good day mates! 🫡

## Who am I? 🤙🏻

I was a lawyer. And I'm now a software engineer. 

I seek to express myself in languages - previously in old-schoool "legalspeak", but now, in languages weirdly named, some even after animals (Python?!). 

I enjoy the creative process of building “things”. A few things I've built: a piece of wooden furniture, a cup of experimental coffee, a Spotify playlist, a photography portfolio, a championship-winning team on Football Manager, interspersed with a few fun digital projects. I'm basically a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to my "passions" but I do like seeing Tottenham Hotspur win games (which unfortunately don't happen as much as I would like it to). 

With my background in intellectual property and tech law, my goal is to build safe and ethical (or kick-ass) products that positively impact the world.

## What am I up to now? 🧐

I'm currently learning **TypeScript** and **Java**, while working on a couple of personal projects.
